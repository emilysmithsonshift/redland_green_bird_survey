      'these boxes will not rot away or deteriorate and are guaranteed for 10 years. '
      '\n\nThis robust material safeguards against attacks from predators such as woodpeckers, '
      'cats and squirrels, whilst also providing a well insulated interior with a more '
      'consistent internal temperature than an ordinary wooden box. \n\nThis is especially '
      'important during the breeding season and ensures that young birds have a greater '
      'chance of survival. Nesting sites have become rare for cavity nesting birds as the result of '
      'changed woodland management practices, which have resulted in fewer ancient trees. '
      'Nest boxes provide a much needed alternative both for breeding birds and for birds which use them as winter roosting sites.'
      '\n\nThese boxes were purchased thanks to a generous grant from the Redland and Cotham Amenities Society (RCAS).';
