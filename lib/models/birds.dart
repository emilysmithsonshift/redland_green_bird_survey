        "The robin’s red breast, beautiful song and inquisitive behaviour make it one of the UK’s favourite birds. \n\nMales and females have the same appearance, and sing for most of the year in order to protect their territories, only ceasing to sing briefly in late summer, when they are moulting. They are extremely territorial and don’t tolerate intruders to their territories. They will also sing at night near street lights.\n\nJuveniles have speckled golden brown breasts, and gain their red breasts after their first moult. Each robin has an unique breast pattern.\n\nAbout 14cm long and 14-21g in weight, robins eat insects and invertebrates, worms, seeds and fruit. Robins and dunnocks have similar diets. In winter, when food is scarce, this results in competition between them. The robin will therefore often chase the dunnock out of its territory. \n\nRobins can have up to three, and maybe even four broods in a year, but each time they build a new nest, and so they will probably only use a nest box once in the same year. They are most likely to use an open-fronted nest box.\n\nIt’s estimated there are over 6.7 million breeding territories in the UK.",

        "At 14cm long and weighing 18g, the great tit is the largest of the UK’s eight tit species. Males and females are alike, with blue grey wings and green backs. They have white cheeks and glossy black heads. The black continues as a thick stripe down the centre of their yellow chests and abdomen. The male’s stripe is thicker than the female’s, whose stripe is often discontinuous. The thicker the male’s stripe, the more attractive he is to the female as it indicates how good a father the bird will be.\n\nGreat tits eat insects, caterpillars, seeds and nuts. Like other tits, they prefer not to be out in the open for long: they are a woodland bird, but have readily moved into the gardens of built-up areas and have become familiar visitors to bird feeders. \n\nThe great tit has up to 40 types of calls and songs. The “teacher, teacher” call, used to assert a territory, is one of the most familiar. The female rarely calls. Individual males with large repertoires of songs and calls are more dominant birds, and also more successful breeders.\n\nNests are made from moss and grass, and lined with hair and feathers. Great tits will also readily use nest boxes. A clutch can be up to 15 eggs. Eggs, laid in April or May, are incubated by the female for about 2 weeks. Both parents feed the young after fledging. Occasionally great tits will have a second brood in the breeding season. Nests may sometimes contain blue tit eggs. It’s thought this might be because the great tit evicted a blue tit from a good nesting site, or perhaps it could be that a blue tit without a nest of its own has managed to lay eggs there. \n\nThere are estimated to be around 2.5 million breeding territories in the UK.",

        "Blue tits are among the most frequent visitors to our bird feeders and are also quite gregarious, visiting feeders in small groups. They eat insects, spiders, caterpillars, seeds and nuts. They are 12cm in length and 11g in weight – up to half the weight of robins. \n\nMales and females are striking birds, with their colourful mix of blue, yellow, white and green feathers. The blue cap on their head can be raised into a little crest. \n\nBlue tits are notable for their acrobatic skills, often hanging upside down while searching for food. \n\nLike all tits, blue tits usually nest in tree holes. They start prospecting for a place to nest as early as January. The female makes the nest from moss, grass, leaves, hair and spiders’ webs, lining them with feathers, fur or wool. Up to 16 eggs are usually laid from mid-April. The female incubates the eggs alone for 12-15 days, and the male brings her food. Both parents feed the young after fledging. A pair usually has only one brood in the year, but if food is plentiful, they may have a second brood. Sometimes, great tit eggs are found in blue tit nests.\n\nThe breeding population of the British Isles is around 3.5 million breeding territories, and the number of birds may increase to 15 million birds with over-wintering European blue tits. Blue tit numbers have been increasing in recent years, and this may be the result of bird boxes and feeders, to which they have readily adapted. Blue tits are probably the most common bird found in nest boxes.",

They eat worms, insects, berries and fruit, and can often be seen on lawns with their heads tilted to one side as they listen for earthworms.\n\nThe blackbird has a beautiful rich song, which is part learned and part improvised. Typically, they like to sing after rain, and sometimes sing at night, particularly if they are near street lights.\n\nMales are black with an orange-yellow beak and eye ring, while females are dark brown, often with paler streaks and spots on their breasts. The birds are 24-25cm in length and weigh between 80-100g. \n\nBlackbirds rear 2-3 broods a season, and may attempt a fourth brood in a good year. The same nest, made of plant material lined with mud and grass, is sometimes used for successive broods. A clutch is normally 3-5 eggs, and is incubated by the female. Hatching takes place 13-14 days after laying. Only the female broods the chicks, but both parents feed them.\n\nIt’s estimated there are over 5 million breeding pairs in the British Isles. In the autumn months, blackbird numbers are swelled by migrant blackbirds from Scandinavia and continental Europe. Some stay here for the winter; others continue further south.",

        "The song thrush is about 23cm in length and 65-100g in weight. Both sexes have a rich brown head, wings and back, and a creamy breast covered in dark brown spots. \n\nAs the bird’s name suggests, their song is rich and beautiful, with a series of repeated phrases. Some males have up to 100 different phrases, partly learned from parents and partly acquired through mimicry, and so each bird’s song is different. They start singing in late winter and continue through into June or July. They are also one of the earliest birds to start singing in the morning, perhaps starting at around 3am. They sing again at dusk, and like to sing on prominent branches high up in a tree.\n\nSong thrushes eat invertebrates, earthworms, soft fruit and berries. When the earth is too hard to enable them to extract worms, they also eat snails, using a stone “anvil” to crack open the shell. This is a behaviour unique to the song thrush. \n\nWhile song thrushes will take food that is put out for them, such as windfall apples and mealworms, they are timid birds, easily chased away by birds such as the blackbird.\n\nSong thrush can have 2-3 broods a year, between March and August. They nest in trees and shrubs or among creepers on walls and often using the same nest for successive broods in the season. The nest, built by the female, is cup-shaped and, if in a tree, built close to the trunk. Nests are made of twigs, grass and moss, and are bonded together and lined with mud, dun, leaves and rotten wood. They can take three weeks to complete. \n\nThe female lays 3-5 eggs, at the rate of one per day. She starts to incubate after the last egg is laid, and broods until the chicks hatch after 13-15 days. Both parents feed the young. The chicks are ready to leave the nest at about 13-14 days old. Parents continue to feed the young birds until they can fend for themselves, about 3 weeks after fledging.\n\nIt’s thought there are about 1.2 million breeding territories in the UK, and the birds tend to stay in them the year round. The population declined more than 50% between 1970 and 1995, probably because of loss of habitat. More recently, there’s been a slight recovery in their numbers.",

Their upper parts, including the head are blue-grey, underside creamy-yellow and sides orange-brown. They have a black eye stripe and white cheeks. Their legs are short and yellowish-brown and the toes are powerful enough to grip trunks as they move up, down and around trees in search of food. \n\nTheir name derives from the term ‘nut hacker’, which describes the way in which they open up nuts, by wedging them into a crevice and hammering them with their strong bills. \n\nThey feed mainly on nuts and seeds (such as hazel nuts, acorns and beech mast in the autumn and winter) and insects in the summer. They have started to visit bird feeders in gardens, competing boldly with other birds, and often taking the food away to store.\n\nStoring food is one of the factors making nuthatches highly territorial throughout the year. They proclaim their territories using loud, simple calls, and are highly sedentary, seldom moving far from where they hatched.\n\nNuthatches nest in holes in trees or walls and particularly favour the old nest holes of great spotted woodpeckers. The best habitat for nuthatches is large, old oak trees. They may use nest boxes with a large hole of around 35mm diameter, and are likely to plaster its entrance with mud. Their nests are made from pieces of bark and dead leaves. They lay 4-13 eggs and may have a second clutch of eggs. Contrary to many other birds, their numbers have increased since the 1970s and their range has also expanded northwards, into Scotland. It’s not known why.\n\nIt’s estimated that there are around 220,000 territories, mostly in England and Wales.",

    description:
        "Starlings are attractive birds, with breeding plumages of glossy iridescent purples, blues and greens, pinks and cream. Their plumage at other times of year is more muted, with brown feathers and white markings. At 21-22 cm in length, they are smaller than blackbirds, and have thin, yellow, medium length beaks and short tails. In the breeding season, males and females can be distinguished by their beaks: those of males have blue bases, and females, pink. \n\nIn flight their wings form a triangular shape. Their flight is fast and direct. They are noisy and very sociable birds, spending much of the year in flocks. \n\nWhile they are still regarded as a common garden bird, their numbers have declined sharply elsewhere since the 1980s, even though their natural habitats are very varied, including coastal and inland wetlands, grassland, woodland and farmland. This decline has placed them on the red list. There are estimated to be 1.8 million pairs in the UK. \n\nIn September and October, resident birds’ numbers are increased by the arrival of birds from northern Europe and Scandinavia which overwinter in the UK, escaping more severe conditions in their countries of origin. It is during the winter that the spectacular aerial gatherings known as murmurations may be seen as dusk approaches. Murmurations are collective movements to confuse and evade predators, such as falcons or hawks. Thousands of birds fly in close synchronised formation, diving and wheeling and producing spectacular aerial patterns before plunging into their night time communal roost. Roosts may be in trees such as conifers, in reedbeds, or in manmade structures such as piers. \n\nStarlings mostly eat invertebrates such as earthworms, leatherjackets, spiders and moths, but also seeds and fruit. They often search for food on grass, probing the ground for invertebrates with their beaks. However, their diet contains an increasing proportion of plant matter from the summer onwards. In response to this, their intestines increase in length, to adjust for the greater difficulty of digesting plant matter.  \n\nMale starlings will establish breeding territories from January onwards. The male will attempt to defend a number of suitable nesting sites in tree cavities or below roof tiles, and try to attract several females. However, there is stiff competition for nesting sites, and most starlings therefore end up with one nesting site and one mate. In late March or early April, males build their nests from leaves and dry grass and attract a female by singing near the nest. The female completes the nest, adding moss and feathers. 4-7 eggs are usually laid in mid-April, and these, brooded by the female, hatch about two weeks later. Both parents raise the chicks.  A pair may produce 1-3 clutches a season \n\nSome females engage in what is known as brood parasitism, by depositing one of their eggs in the nest of another female. The females which do this tend to be birds which haven’t yet secured a mate or a nest site. Even though many of them do go on to have a nest of their own later in the season, giving them another chance to breed, the incentive for brood parasitism is that earlier breeding probably gives the resulting young birds a better chance of survival. \n\nThe decline of nesting sites is thought to be one of the factors responsible for the starling’s decline in numbers. In urban areas, modern building practices, including renovations, mean that cavities under roof tiles and behind barge boards and soffits no longer exist, denying starlings nesting opportunities that used to be plentiful. Starlings will, however, readily use nest boxes designed specifically for them. \n\nBirds of prey and domestic cats number amongst the starling’s main predators.",

Crows are entirely black, including their beaks, feet and legs, though the feathers on their heads, wings and backs have green and purple iridescences. Their thighs are neatly feathered.\n\nCrows are found in a wide variety of habitats, from woodlands to wetland and heathlands. They are intelligent, opportunistic and adaptable birds and have colonised cities readily. \n\nThey eat a range of foods including carrion, fruit, grain, invertebrates, small mammals, frogs, and the eggs and chicks of other birds. Their diet changes across the seasons, with predation upon eggs and chicks tending to be related to the need to feed their own young. As crows have only one clutch of eggs a season, predation on other birds is in general limited to the breeding season. However, crows will occasionally hunt together to predate other birds, sometimes catching them in flight. They will also harass other birds, or animals such as foxes, for their kills. Studies have found a crow’s diet can consist of over 1000 different food items.\n\nCarrion crows generally pair for life. They breed between late March and early June. Both birds build the nest, which may be in a variety of places (tree forks, old buildings, cliffs, and elsewhere) using an assortment of materials including twigs, bones and even wire. They reinforce the nests with mud, and line them with bark, wool, feathers, grass, paper, hair and other materials. They generally lay 3-4 eggs, which are incubated by the female for 18-20 days. The male feeds her during incubation. Both parents bring food to the chicks. The chicks fledge 4-5 weeks after hatching, and are dependent upon their parents for several more weeks.\n\nWhile crows have large territories centred upon their nests, neighbouring crows will sometimes co-operate to ‘mob’ or chase away potential predators or intruders. Crows maintain their territories year round, although they may depart overnight for communal roosts in winter. \n\nIt’s estimated that there are around 1 million breeding pairs in the UK, although they aren’t found in north and west Scotland or in Northern Ireland.",

Adults are brightly coloured golden-green birds with red faces, white necks, black caps and eye markings, and black wings with yellow patches; juveniles lack the red faces. Goldfinches are a little smaller than robins. They are seed specialists, with long fine beaks which allow them to extract seeds from plants such a thistles and teasels that other birds can’t reach. They also eat insects. \n\nThey have a beautiful, liquid twittering song and are highly sociable birds, often breeding in loose colonies and flying in small flocks. It’s a restless bird, often on the wing, and often singing as it flies. In a good year, they may raise several broods of around 5 chicks. In winter, larger flocks of maybe 100 birds will congregate and search for food. In very poor winter weather, some birds may migrate to France and Spain. \n\nGoldfinches can often be seen in Redland’s allotments and parks. They benefit from areas with trees and bushes and untended places with plants bearing seeds. Places are kept wild for species such as the goldfinch in Redland’s allotments. \n\nThere are estimated to be around 1.2 million breeding pairs in the UK. Their numbers have grown considerably since they became a protected species; prior to that, human persecution had caused steep declines in their numbers.",

        "Long-tailed tits are small and dainty birds of around 14cm in length. They are easily recognisable because their tails are longer than their body length. Long-tailed tits have black, white and pink backs, white heads with black eyestripes and pale pink undersides. Their tails are black and white. Their black beaks are short. They have an undulating flight pattern. \n\nDespite their name, long-tailed tits aren’t closely related to the other British tits, and belong to a different family, Aegithalidae, the tit family being the Paridae family. \n\nThey are very sociable birds, generally spending their time in groups of up to 20 individuals, and are seldom seen alone. In winter they may form larger flocks with other species of tit. Long-tailed tits are insect and invertebrate specialists, although they do eat seeds in winter when food is scarce. The birds are very acrobatic, and pluck their prey from trees and other vegetation. \n\nIn winter, the birds roost overnight in groups in trees and shrubs, and nestle together very closely in order to avoid losing body heat, a threat resulting from their very small body mass. They are one of the species that might use nest boxes to roost in during winter. Mortality can be as high as 80% in very cold winters. \n\nThey love the cover of trees and bushes, and can be heard making contact calls with each other that sound rather like a high-pitched “tsee-tsee-tsee”. Their song is characterised by trills and twittering. \n\nPlentiful tree and bush cover around Redland Green, and particularly in the neighbouring allotments provide a haven for these beautiful birds, and they can be seen and heard around Redland Green. \n\nThere are estimated to be 340,000 breeding territories in the UK. Their numbers have been increasing in the last decades, possibly because of fat and seeds put out on bird tables and in feeders.",

        "The magpie (or Eurasian magpie) is a very distinctive and handsome bird and one of the easiest corvids to identify. It is a pied, or black and white bird whose wing and tail feathers feature blue and blue-green-purple iridescence. Males and females look alike, but the female is slightly smaller. They are 44-46cm long with the tail accounting for over half of this length, and weigh 200-250g. They are very sociable and vocal birds.\n\nHowever, possibly more than any other bird, the magpie is associated with a range of mostly negative superstitions both across ages and in many different cultures. This could be because as scavengers, magpies have been associated with death, and because of that, with bad luck. The Victorians feared the magpie, and hunted it almost to extinction. It is also disliked because it predates the nests of other birds, particularly song birds.\n\nMagpies are omnivorous, and as well as predating nests and feeding on carrion and road kill, they eat invertebrates, fruit and berries and small mammals. They hoard food when it is scarce, hiding the food in a hole in the ground which they cover with leaves or grass.\n\nBoth birds make the nest, with the male collecting most of the materials for it. The nest is a large cup of twigs, grass, hair and mud, surrounded by a dome made from larger twigs, and with one or two entrances, although some birds don’t bother with domes. The nest, located in dense bushes or high up in trees, may take 5-6 weeks to make. The female lays around 5-8 eggs, which she incubates for around 19 days. The male feeds the female while she is brooding. The young fledge after about four weeks and continue to be fed by the parents for up to a month. The family stays together as a unit until the autumn. Young birds may form flocks, and feed and roost together.\n\nBreeding magpies maintain their territories all year round. As there are more individuals in an area than there are nesting sites available, many birds do not breed.\n\nIt’s estimated there are around 600,000 breeding territories in the UK.",

    description:
        "The great spotted woodpecker one of three woodpeckers native to Britain. It is a bird that is shy of humans, and so can be difficult to see. It is more commonly heard than seen.\n\nThis species is a broadleaved woodland specialist, but is very adaptable, and is also found in coniferous woodland, and parks and gardens where trees are plentiful. They particularly like oak and horn beam trees.\n\nThe great spotted woodpecker is a pied (black and white) woodpecker. At 21-23 cm long, it is about starling sized. It weights about 85 grams. The male and female are very similar, with a white underside, white and black back and wings and white cheeks and shoulder patches. Both male and female have a bright red underside at the base of the tail, but only the male has a red patch at the back of his neck. The nape of the female’s neck is white. Juveniles may be seen in summer: they are distinguished from their parents by having a red cap, which disappears after their first moult.\n\nThey have very strong claws for gripping the bark, and also use their stiff tail feathers as support when hopping up trees and gripping while chiselling and drumming. They have two toes which point frontwards, and two pointing backwards.\n\nThe great spotted woodpecker flight pattern is undulating. This is because it folds its wings against its body every few wing flaps.\n\nDead trees, rich in insect life, are an important location of food for them. The woodpecker probes both living and dead trees for larvae and insects, uses its powerful beak to hammer holes in the bark. Their extremely long and sticky tongues assist in extracting insects, spiders and caterpillars from crevices and holes. In winter they feed on nuts and berries, and will visit bird feeders for suet, peanuts and seeds throughout the year. Woodpeckers will take eggs and nestlings from nests, including from nest boxes. If nest boxes are made of wood, they will enlarge the size of the hole to gain entry.\n\nThe woodpecker is known for its drumming. This is a rapid hammering on a trunk of up to 20 times per second, which lasts a few seconds. Drumming serves several functions. It may be used to maintain contact between a pair, but its main function is to establish and proclaim a territory. The species is strongly territorial. The bird chooses a healthy tree on which to drum, in order to make the loudest sound. Both males and females drum from the late winter. The male drums more frequently than the female. Drumming usually ceases after the young have fledged.\n\nTerritorial and contact drumming are a more rapid drumming than that which characterises the bird’s nest-making chiselling.\n\nThe great spotted woodpecker nests in mature and old trees, excavating a hole in the trunk or branch by chiselling a cavity, and lining it with wood chip. It can take up to four weeks for a pair to chisel out a cavity, but the work is shared equally between male and female. The woodpeckers make a new nest hole every year, which means they have a significant ecological role in leaving many potential nest sites for other birds and animals. They may also use old holes as night time roosts.\n\nGreat spotted woodpeckers are monogamous in a breeding season, but may have different partners in different seasons.\n\nBreeding starts in mid-April. 3-8 eggs are laid, and there’s generally just one clutch in a breeding season. Both parents incubate and feed the young. Incubation takes around 2 weeks, and fledging occurs about 3 weeks after hatching. After fledging, the adults continue to feed the young for another 10 or so days.\n\nIt’s estimated that there are around 140,000 breeding pairs, mostly in England and Wales.",

        "The woodpigeon is the UK’s largest and most common pigeon. It’s a plump bird with a length of 40-42cm and weighs around half a kilo. Largely grey, the woodpigeon has a pinkish breast, iridescent green and purple neck feathers, a white neck patch and white wing patches. The bird is found across the UK, having extended its original habitat of woodlands and fields to urban parks and gardens. Its distinctive cooing call is a sound familiar to most. \n\nIts fondness for brassicas (such cabbages, kale, brussels sprouts) and peas and grains makes it unpopular with farmers and allotmenters. It also eats buds, shoots, seeds and berries, as well as invertebrates such as insects and worms. In winter, the birds can fill their crops with seeds and other food, which they digest overnight. The crops can hold a considerable amount of food. \n\n Although the bird is on the amber list of conservation concern, as an agricultural pest the bird is shot throughout the year, and it’s also possible to buy wood pigeon for eating. \n\n Pigeons breed any time throughout the year. Their nests are generally made in forks of trees or on branches, and look like rather untidy accumulations of twigs. They often re-use their nests. No more than two eggs are laid in each brood. \n\n Woodpigeons feed their young on “pigeon milk” – a regurgitated and extremely rich milky substance produced in the parents’ crops (a food-storage organ) during the breeding season. This ensures the young birds put on weight very rapidly. \n\n There are estimated to be 5.4 million breeding pairs in UK. Numbers have increased in the last 50 years, and it’s thought this might be because of the cultivation of winter cereals and oilseed rape, providing more winter food. In the autumn, many wood pigeons from the continent migrate here to overwinter and large flocks may form. Woodpigeons are often found on and around Redland Green.",
