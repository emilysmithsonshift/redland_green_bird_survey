      question: 'What birds might I see (or hear) around Redland Green?',
      answer:
          'Redland Green and the adjacent allotments harbour a wide variety of species. These include tits (coal tit, long-tailed tit, blue tit, great tit), goldfinches, robins, wrens, blackbirds and song thrush, starlings, corvids (carrion crows, jackdaw, magpies and jays), woodpeckers (great spotted and green), nuthatch and wood pigeons. Seasonal visitors include swifts, house martins and chiffchaff (spring and summer) and fieldfare, redwing and blackcaps in the winter (though some blackcaps have become year round residents). You might also hear or see sparrowhawks and tawny owls. \n\nWe owe this considerable variety of species to the varied habitats offered by the Green and the allotments, particularly afforded by the veteran ash and oak trees in both places, which provide nesting sites and food. Bird tables in gardens also support some bird populations, although they could not do so without the habitat needed for nesting and roosting.',

This Act protects animals that are resident in, or visit (e.g. in summer or winter migrations) the UK as well as plants and habitats. This means it is an offence to kill, injure or trap any wild bird or take or destroy its eggs. It’s also an offence to: interfere with the nest while it’s being built and used; and to do anything with disturbs the bird while it’s nest building, brooding and caring for its young, and to harm the young.

          'Ultraviolet light has a shorter wavelength than light in the spectrum that is visible to humans, but ultra-violet light is visible to insects, birds and some mammals. Phenomena visible in UV light might function to communicate messages between animals, both within and between species. For example, the blue crown feathers on blue tits’ heads reflect UV light, making the crown glow brightly. Brighter crown feathers have been shown to be associated with successful fledging of chicks; and females with brighter crowns also seem to be preferred by males. Brighter crowns on female blue tits may therefore signal reproductive success to males. There is still a lot to learn!',

These include bad weather and low food supplies, but predation is a major factor. Most of the birds described in this app, or their eggs, are predated by a wide range of animals, including cats, foxes, grey squirrels, weasels, sparrow hawks, magpies, jays, crows and woodpeckers. All of these species exist in or around the green, except for weasels (no known sightings).

The red list includes birds of the greatest conservation concern, with species showing severe (more than 50%) contraction in their breeding populations and breeding ranges over a given period. They need urgent action to reverse these declines. The amber list are birds that have shown moderate (25% - 50%) breeding population and breeding range declines. The green list is of birds that are not currently of conservation concern. The last review showed that 67 UK birds, or more than a quarter of the UK’s regularly occurring bird species, are now on the red list.',

          'What sorts of trees are likely to have holes and cavities that birds can nest in?',
      answer:
          'Holes are found mainly in old trees. This is one of many reasons why old trees are so important to protect, as they provide habitat for a huge range of species in addition to birds. There are many reasons holes develop. Holes may develop as the result of injury caused by forces such as wind or lightening, or attacks by insects, bacteria or fungi. Holes can take a long time to form, and can vary in size, depth, shape, insulation and size of entrance hole, making them suitable for many different animals. Holes can also be created by birds which use them to nest, and sometimes roost in.\n\nFor example, the ancient trees in the green – the ash and the oak – contain many holes and are therefore very significant in the ecology of the green. Many of these holes have been made by great spotted woodpeckers, which create a new nesting hole each year.',

          'The changing climate is causing important ecological events to happen at different times than in the past. It has been observed that spring events such as trees budding and a peak in caterpillar numbers are now happening earlier by about 3 weeks. Birds such as blue and great tits and pied flycatchers lay their eggs at a time which enables them to take advantage of this great bounty of caterpillars for feeding their young. If the flush of food is now happening earlier, what are the consequences for birds if they are not able to adapt and breed earlier? This is the phenological mismatch: events that used to be synchronised are no longer, as they are shifting at different rates. These changes and their consequences are the subjects of active research.',

Swifts nest under eaves and within roof cavities; one of the reasons they are declining is that modern buildings have fewer holes for them to nest in. Swifts will use nest boxes, but these need to be located high up, usually on buildings; some far-sighted developers now incorporate swift bricks into the walls and near the roof line of new-build houses.

Birds in the tit family, Paridae, used to be known as ‘titmouses’ (or ‘titmice’) and occasionally today the full name ‘titmouse’ is still used, as in ‘blue titmouse’ or ‘great titmouse’. The ‘tit’ component is of Norse origin, and means ‘small object or creature’, although an alternative view is that the word might have evolved in the fourteenth century as an echo of the bird’s song. ‘Mouse’, evolved from a Norse word ‘mose’ meaning “small bird”.

A distinguishing characteristic of the passerines is that they have three toes directed forwards and one directed backwards; an arrangement which makes it easier to perch on branches. Their legs have a further adaptation: a tendon, which runs from the toes to a muscle in the leg tightens when the leg bends. This causes the foot to curl and tighten when the bird lands on the branch. This is the reason that passerines can perch in trees while asleep without falling off. With more than 6,500 species belonging to more than 140 families, passerines include more than half of all bird species. Many of the birds in Redland Green, including the corvids (crow family) are passerines.

Robins, wrens,  oldfinches, long-tailed tits, coal tits, nuthatches, pied flycatchers and pied wagtails live on average for two years. Blackbirds and song thrushes, the house sparrow, and blue and great tits average three years. Starlings live on average for five years. However, sometimes individuals greatly exceed the average lifespan. The oldest known pied flycatcher was over 16 years old and one pied wagtail reached 11.

The most significant difference in appearance is that they have a fine pointed bill like a robin, not the thick bill of the sparrow. Another clue is that house sparrows congregate in flocks, while dunnocks are usually seen alone or in pairs. While having a superficial resemblance to sparrows, they are not related to them, and belong to a different family. Dunnocks are common, and often found in gardens. However, they are shy birds, not venturing much out into the open, and so may not be noticed.

      question: "Why does the robin have such a brightly coloured breast?",
      answer:
          "Red feathers make birds much more vulnerable to predation, so it seems strange that robins have such bright chests. It’s thought, however, that the males’ red breasts could signal fitness and good survival skills to female robins, making them attractive potential mates. Adding support to this theory, it’s also been found that the older a male robin is, the larger the area of red on his chest. This also signals to other robins that the bird is a capable survivor. The larger area of red of older males may also signal to juveniles that they would be wise not to intrude into the bird’s territory. They are likely to lose any fight they take on! In many bird species, females are much less colourful than the males. This makes them harder to spot when they are incubating eggs – a clear survival strategy. When female robins incubate their eggs, their breast is normally out of view, facing downwards in close contact with the eggs. Only her brown back is showing – and this is excellent camouflage. Females also defend their territories, and so their red breast acts as a signal to other robins to keep out of their territory.",

      question: "What is the mating behaviour of dunnocks?",
      answer:
          "Dunnocks are unlike most other song birds in that they have a variety of mating systems, and which may differ from one breeding season to another. In polyandry, females mate with two or more males. In polygyny, two or more females mate with one male, and only that male. They also practice polygynandry, in which males and females both mate with two or more mates, and monogamy (the female and male mate only with each other) in a breeding season. The system that is adopted depends upon a multiplicity of factors. One is the ratio of females to males in an area; another is the degree to which territories overlap. Monogamy is likely if one female and one male territory overlap. If two or three female territories overlap one male territory, the birds are likely to be polygamous. If two males co-operate to defend a territory that has several females, they will adopt polygynandry. Polyandry is the most common breeding system overall. With respect to an individual bird’s success in passing on its genes, polygyny favours males, and polyandry favours females. Another factor that influences breeding behaviour is the availability of food. Female territories reduce in size if food is plentiful. This makes it easier for males to have exclusive access to females. These factors mean that different mating behaviours will be adopted by the same birds in different breeding seasons.",

      question: "Why do robins feature so often on Christmas cards?",
      answer:
          "In the Victorian era, postmen wore red jackets. The tradition of sending cards began in the same era. The Victorians were very fond of robins, and robins began to feature on Christmas cards, delivering letters like tiny postmen. And so it was that postmen acquired the nickname of “robins”, thus beginning this long association.",

      question: "Why don’t I see greenfinches very often?",
      answer:
          "Sadly, greenfinches have suffered a very dramatic decline in their numbers, as the result of a disease called avian trichomonosis. This appeared in the UK in 2005 and is caused by parasitic organism called Trichomonas gallinae which contaminates water and food. Birds afflicted with the parasite become unable to eat or drink and die of starvation or thirst. It’s thought that poor hygiene at bird feeders and bird baths contributed to the rapid spread of the disease, as it is highly contagious, with multiple ways of spreading between birds. It’s thought that around 12% of the UK’s former population of 4 million birds might have died as the result of this disease. There are concerns that the greenfinch could become endangered as the result of this disease. The greenfinch is not the only bird that may be affected by this parasite, although it appears to have suffered most seriously from it. Chaffinches, goldfinches, house sparrows and bullfinches can also be infected.",

          "Which birds on Redland Green are members of the corvid family?",
      answer:
          "On Redland Green, resident corvids, or members of the crow family, include carrion crows, jackdaws, jays and magpies. But occasionally, if you’re lucky, you might see or hear a raven (Corvus corax) flying high above the green. \n\nRavens used to be common residents of towns and cities, but persecution reduced their numbers to just 1,000 pairs, most of which were far from urban areas. Ravens have more recently been expanding their range once again, and they now number around 12,000 breeding pairs in the UK, a rare conservation success story. \n\nWhile they have not in general returned to urban areas, ravens now breed in the Avon Gorge. The raven is the largest of the corvids in the UK with a wingspan of 120-150cm: bigger than that of a buzzard. \n\nIt has a thick neck with shaggy throat feathers, a thick black bill, and a long, diamond or wedge-shaped tail. \n\nThe raven’s call is very distinctive: a deep “cronk”. By contrast, the carrion crow, the bird most likely to be confused with a raven, has a wingspan of 93-104cm. Its tail has a rounded fan-like shape, and its call is a higher pitched “caw caw”.",

      question: "Do carrion crows have predators?",
      answer:
          "As carrion crows are large birds with good defensive abilities and that will act together to drive potential predators away, they do not have many predators. While sparrowhawks nest in Redland, carrion crows are both larger and heavier than female sparrowhawks (which are larger and heavier than male sparrowhawks). Adult crows are not likely to be bothered by the presence of sparrowhawks, although sparrowhawks could attempt to predate fledgling crows. However, birds such as the peregrine falcon and the golden eagle will hunt crows. Those crows local to Redland Green are unlikely to have much to worry about from avian predation, although perhaps they should not be too complacent, as peregrine falcons do breed in the Avon Gorge, and elsewhere in Bristol.",

Tawnies favour deciduous woodland and nest in tree cavities and old buildings. Their main prey are mice and voles, but they also eat frogs and invertebrates, and sometimes small birds. They are ambush predators, and typically watch for prey from a perch, hunting at dusk and during the night. Females typically weigh about 500g and males rather less than 400g.There are estimated to be 50,000 breeding pairs in the UK. Their conservation status is amber. ",

      question: "Do sparrowhawks control how many small birds are in an area?",
      answer:
          "Although sparrowhawks predate small birds, the short answer is “no, they don’t”. That’s because the number of sparrowhawks in a given area is limited by the “carrying capacity” of the habitat, which means that the amount of food and availability of nesting sites constrain how many individuals can survive. Young birds don’t pair and breed until there is vacant territory and plentiful food. This means that there is a close relationship between the number of small birds and sparrowhawks. Both increases and decreases in small bird populations are mirrored by corresponding changes in the number of sparrowhawks. Sparrowhawks are therefore indicators of the health of an ecosystem.",

      question: "Are there any kestrels in Redland?",
      answer:
          "There aren’t any known sightings of kestrels in Redland, although kestrels have adapted to live in cities. The kestrel, a member of the falcon family, and with the long, scythe-like wings of that family, hunts by hovering 10-20 metres over grassland, spotting prey with its extremely sharp eyesight and plummeting to the ground in pursuit of a kill. Females are larger than males. Kestrels’ main prey are small mammals such as voles, shrews and mice, although they may also take small birds, lizards and invertebrates. When hovering, the kestrel’s tail is spread into a fan shape. Sparrowhawks do not hover, being ambush predators of mainly birds, so hunting technique is one of the ways of telling these two species apart."
          "\n\nKestrel populations have fallen, and they are now on the "
          "amber list of conservation concern. This may because modern farming practices have eliminated wide field margins, therefore also eliminating the habitat of the kestrel’s main prey items. The UK population of kestrels may be as low as 30,000 pairs. ",

      question: "What is a ‘murmuration’?",
      answer:
          "Murmuration derives from the word “murmur”, which is a low sound, such as a rumble. In winter, many small groups of starlings join together at dusk to form a huge flock (thousands, or even millions of individuals) and fly in a tight, synchronised formation, making spectacular and ever shifting patterns in the sky for a variable period of time, before they descend into their chosen communal roost for the night. They roost communally both for protection and to share bodily warmth. The noise made by the beating of many pairs of wings as they perform these spectacular airborne manoeuvrings sounds rather like murmuring – hence the name. It is thought that starlings murmurate to avoid predation by dazzling and confusing their predators. These include peregrine falcons, marsh harriers and several other raptors.",

      question:
          "How do starlings avoid colliding with each other in a murmuration?",
      answer:
          "In a murmuration, starlings may be flying in close formation at speeds of over 90mph, and although the flock performs frequent changes of direction, collisions don’t happen. Although murmurations are far from fully understood, it is thought that a process known as “scale-free correlation” ensures individuals don’t collide. It seems that each bird in the flock communicates only with its 6 or 7 nearest neighbours, following their cues and copying their movements. A change of direction by a single bird will be copied by its neighbours, and then by their neighbours, thus propagating through all or most of the flock. An analogy with this is the way in which particles move in an avalanche, with the same process of scale-free correlation.",
